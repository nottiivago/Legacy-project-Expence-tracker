# Cash Overflow - A class project (Duration: 7 days, Participants: 2)

## Purpose
This application allows users to edit four different categories (Income, Core, Flow, and Overflow) while calculating and displaying the total amount for each category.

## Technologies
> - React
> - Tailwind
> - Node JS/ Mongoose/ Express
> - bcrypt/ cors/ jsonwebtoken

We chose these technologies based on one main criterion: SPEED. They allowed us to code with ease since we were both familiar with them, while also ensuring lightning-fast loading times!

## Future
We aim to introduce monthly and yearly analysis, charts, and financial advice on how to reduce unnecessary expenses, empowering user to ***GIVE YOURSELF A RAISE!!!***
